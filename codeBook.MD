## Course project - Codebook
============================
## Step:1
- traindata: dataframe created from X_train.txt
- testData: dataframe created from X_test.txt
- testSubject: dataframe created from subject_test.txt
- trainSubject: dataframe created from subject_train.txt
- testLabel: dataframe created from y_test.txt
- trainLabel: dataframe created from y_train.txt

- trainSubjectData: dataframe created by combining trainData,trainSubject
- trainSubjectActivityData: dataframe created by combining trainSubjectData,trainLabel

- testSubjectData: dataframe created by combining testData,testSubject
- testSubjectActivityData: dataframe created by combining testSubjectData,testLabel
- combinedTrainTestData: dataframe created by combining trainSubjectActivityData,testSubjectActivityData

## Step:2
- featureLabel: dataframe created from features.txt
- meanStdIndices: vector created by inspecing the string for mean() and std()


## Step:3

- activityLabel: dataframe created from activity_labels.txt
- combineLabel: dataframe created by combining trainLabel, testLabel

- actLabel: dataframe prepared using combineLabel

## Step:4
- combineLabel: dataframe created by combining trainSubject, testSubject
- cleanedData: dataframe created by combining combineSubject, combineLabel, combinedTrainTestData

## Step:5
- subjectLen: Integer vector that stores the size of subjects
- activityLen: Integer vector that stores the size of activities
- columnLen: Integer vector that stores the measurement count
- result: the matrix created with activity*subject with against measurement
